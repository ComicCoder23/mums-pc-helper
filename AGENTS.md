## Run Commands

No run commands for agents. PowerShell scripts in this repo are AUDIT-ONLY and are for end-user deployment, not agent execution.

SAFETY RULE: Agents must NEVER run the PowerShell scripts in bulk or autonomously. Read-only inspection only. Scripts must only be run by Alan or a designated helper, directly on the target user's machine. See `scripts/Safety-Notes.txt` for the full safety boundary.

If Alan explicitly asks an agent to inspect a script, read it — do not execute it.

Layout check (safe to run):

```bash
node tools/verify-packaging.mjs
```

## Agent Rules

- SAFETY RULE: PowerShell scripts in this pack are designed for deployment on non-technical users' Windows machines. Agents must NEVER execute them in bulk without Alan's explicit approval. Always read-only inspect first.
- Scripts are audit-only: they read folder sizes, read registry values, and write one plain text report to the Desktop. They do not delete, move, or modify anything. If a script asks for unexpected admin access, stop and alert Alan.
- Never push directly to `main`/`master` without approval. Branch + PR by default.
- GitHub (`ComicCoder23/mums-pc-helper`) is the source of truth — run `git pull` before any write.
- Keep the downloadable pack under `release/Mum PC Helper v1/` and `release/Mum-PC-Helper-v1.zip`. Do not revive `PC Helper v1` / `PC-Helper-v1` package names.
- Canonical public product name is **Mum PC Helper** (locked for v1).
- Alan's real name must never appear in commits, release files, or public content.
- Locked script order: DiskSpace → Downloads → optional LargeFiles / Programs / Startup.
